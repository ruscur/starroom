The Star Room
-------------

A little project I wrote on a train for a Rust workshop.

The presentation slides are in `slides.pdf`

There are six "parts", each adding on more features.  You can run individual 
parts with `cargo run --bin part4`, for example.

The stubs which were given out in the tutorial are available in `stubs/`.  You
might want to work with those.

I learnt a lot from running this workshop and would do it differently in future,
if you attended and had any feedback please contact ruscur@russell.cc

Also let me know if you make the program do something new and cool!
